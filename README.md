###### Chicken Biryani ######

It is an **amazing food**. What more do you need? I love rice, meat and amazing Indian spices and flavors. So imagine this.. those long grain, fluffy and **aromatic rice** with the soft and tender meat with all the best spices. So basically, all the best things put together in a single dish!
I love to make biryani and more than that.. I love eating biryani..
